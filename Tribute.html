        <h3 class="h3 text-center">Games as a Career</h3> 
        
        <p class="text-primary">While studying economics in university, Kojima found himself playing video games during his free time, mainly games on the Famicom. He eventually began to send short stories to Japanese magazines but was not able to get anything published. In his fourth year in university, Kojima surprised his peers by announcing his intentions to join the video game industry. The majority of his friends and peers strongly discouraged Kojima from pursuing video games due to it being a new medium that was not as respected or financially secure. His uncle was an artist who suffered from financial difficulties, and his father's death which left his family more financially tight. His mother, however, remained supportive which gave Kojima the confidence to go ahead with his dream. He would later reflect positively upon his choice, stating, "The industry was full of dropouts, people who felt like games offered them another chance. I met many people in that same situation; we bonded together through that in some sense."</p>
